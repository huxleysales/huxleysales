## The Cans

- Customizing your bus to make it like your spec for the bus is allowed.
- You are allowed to add any extra doors (Ex. adding a right side emergency door,handicap door, moving handicap door location). This is not recommended for meshed bodys.
- Changing the size of full size buses are permitted. (Ex. adding 2 more windows in length) This is not allowed for buses sold as shorty.

## The Cannots

- The Hux Chassis was created by TheLadderson and owned by Huxley Sales, theft any code or assets is blacklistable.
- Resale of any Huxley Sales property will result in further action.
- If you wish to use the chassis on a different/personal bus, **you must have permission to do so.**. You cannot use the chassis on a bus you wish to sell.
- If you wish to use a bus to create an entirely different bus, **you must have permission to do so.** (Ex. taking a Thomas FS-65 and making it a Thomas 3800.)
- Reimporting Huxley Sales assets is bannable and blacklistable.

## Bus Help Policies

- We will not be able to help you if you have done heavy chassis edits.
- We will not be able to help you if you do not own the bus.

## Upgrading Policies

- Upgrading the bus happens when we release a bus you own in a new chassis.
- This will cost **R$ 300**
- If you do not own the bus you can not upgrade the chassis.
