## The Cans

- You may do all of the basic speccing thing required to make your bus the spec you want for your group.
- You may take a Stock bus make it a Handi or a Left or Right Side E Door. Its not recommended to do edits like this on buses with all mesh body's.
- You may take a Full Size bus and shorten the bus as needed, But taking a Shorty/Small bus and making it a full size is not permitted.

## The Cannots

- The Huxley Chassis scripting was created by NoobLad2021 and Owned by Huxley Sales, You may not steal any scripting or UI parts for yourself.
- Reselling Huxley sales property will also get you blacklisted.
- Youâ€™re not allowed to take the chassis off of a bus sold from huxley sales to use for your own purposes (If permission given, then you may.)
- You may not take a bus and make a new one without permissions, example taking a Thomas FS-65 and making it a Thomas 3800.
- You may not take Huxley bus parts, export them as a .obj mesh file and reimport them to Roblox.

## Bus Help Policies

- We will not be able to help you if you have done heavy chassis edits.
- We will not be able to help you if you do not own the bus.

## Upgrading Policies

- Upgrading the bus happens when we release a bus you own in a new chassis.
- This will cost **R$ 300**
- If you do not own the bus you can not upgrade the chassis.
