## How do I change the auto numbers for the License Plates?

In `BusSettings`, look for `LicensePlateNN` the fist number is the lowest number the bus will pick when randomly picking the number the second one is the highest number.

## How do I change the Company Number aka the number after the dash?

In `BusSettings` look for `ComNumb` change the number that is in the `" "` to your company number, example `"869"`.
