id: premium
title: ROBLOX Premium

Example Configuration:

```lua
{
	title = "My Category",
    // highlight-next-line
	categoryType = "premium",
}
```

To set a category to ROBLOX premium - just set the `categoryType` to `"premium"` and you're done!

:::note

Premium type makes it so anyone with ROBLOX Premium can spawn a bus
