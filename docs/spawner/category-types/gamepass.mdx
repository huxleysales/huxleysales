id: gamepass
title: Gamepass

Example Configuration:

```lua
{
	title = "My Category",
    // highlight-next-line
	categoryType = "gamepass",
    // highlight-next-line
    assetId = 12345678,
}
```

To set a category to a gamepass - set the `categoryType` to `"gamepass"`

Then, set your `assetId` to the gamepass Id of the gamepass

:::note

Type gamepass makes it so anyoen with a certain gamepass owned can spawn a bus
