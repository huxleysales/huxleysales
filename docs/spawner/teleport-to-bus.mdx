title: Teleporting to your Bus when Spawned

## Enabling bus teleports

First, make sure that `teleportPlayerToBus` is set to `true` in your spawner configuration

## Setting it up in the bus

1. Make a basic part, and set the `transparency` to 0 and anchored.
2. Make sure that part is named `SPWNR_TELEPORT`, this is vital!
3. Place that part where you want, and make sure it is inside the `Body` of the bus (should be the same for GenX, GX+, Huxley, and other buses)

Now it is done! You may duplicate this part and make it so you can teleport to all your buses in your fleet!
